"""resolve-deliverable: workspace's wrapper around the shared evidence_ledger.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (not a fork of evidence_ledger.py -- a thin adapter in front
of it): RCA rca-synthesis-claim-drift-case-001-example.md. A cold second-opinion
review of a finished, gate-passed case synthesis found four factual errors -- a
superseded number quoted after its own correction, an overlap claim not supported
by the record it cited, two entities placed under the wrong upstream in a summary
table, and an external-authority citation tagged as directly verified when it was
a secondhand relay. The fleet already ships a mechanism built for exactly this
(`q-system/.q-system/scripts/evidence_ledger.py`, append-only claim ledger + a
`resolve` check that a document's numbers/quotes trace to a verified row) but it
had never been adopted for workspace. This wrapper is that adoption.

WHY A WRAPPER AND NOT A DIRECT CALL: evidence_ledger.py's number-scanner has no
concept of this instance's own citation convention (`F-014`, `EV-0037`). Its
generic regex reads the digits after the hyphen as a bare number, so a synthesis
document that cites its own findings files by ID produces a wall of false
"traces to no ledger row" failures that have nothing to do with unverified
claims. Measured on SYNTHESIS-2026-09-04.md: roughly a third of its reported
"missing" numbers were finding-citation IDs, not measurements. Stripping that
pattern before handing text to the shared resolver is a workspace-specific
convention, not something the shared skeleton script should special-case for
one instance's naming style -- hence a local wrapper, not an edit to the
skeleton copy (`kipi push` is the only sanctioned path to change shared code).

USAGE:
  python3 resolve-deliverable.py <file.md>       # exit 2 on any real unresolved claim
  python3 resolve-deliverable.py <file.md> --show-stripped   # also print what was stripped, for audit

HONEST BOUNDARY: this strips exactly two citation shapes (`F-<digits>`,
`EV-<digits>`) and nothing else. A number embedded in some other convention this
instance adopts later will read as unresolved again until this list is extended.
It does not change what counts as "resolved" -- a real ledger row is still
required for every other number and quoted span, at full strength.
